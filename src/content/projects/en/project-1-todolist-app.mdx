title: TodoList App
description: A to-do list application that stores data with localStorage. It allows you to create and delete projects, include tasks within each one, show the tasks that exist within them and edit each of them. Organize tasks by trays so you can sort them by proximity in time, Inbox, Today, Tomorrow, Next. To manage dates I have used the external library 'date-fns' as a project dependency.
